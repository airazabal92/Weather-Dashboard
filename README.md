# Weather Dashboard

A weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
The application uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities that are inputted by the user.

## Functionality

- The user can input a city name in the form field, and will be presented with the current and future conditions for that city. The city is added to the search history.
- The user can reference the search history and get the current/future weather for a city without having to input the name again.
- The current weather conditions for the city include the city name, date, an icon representation of the weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.
- The UV index is presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable (green), moderate (orange), or severe (red).
- The future weather conditions present a 5-day forecast with the date, an icon representation of the weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity.
- When the user opens the weather dashboard, they are presented with the last searched city forecast.

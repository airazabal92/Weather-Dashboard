## Functionality

- The user can input a city name in the form field, and will be presented with the current and future conditions for that city. The city is added to the search history.
- The user can reference the search history and get the current/future weather for a city without having to input the name again.
- The current weather conditions for the city include the city name, date, an icon representation of the weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.
- The UV index is presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable (green), moderate (orange), or severe (red).
- The future weather conditions present a 5-day forecast with the date, an icon representation of the weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity.
- When the user opens the weather dashboard, they are presented with the last searched city forecast.
